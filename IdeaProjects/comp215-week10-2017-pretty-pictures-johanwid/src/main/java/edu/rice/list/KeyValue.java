   * Says the documentation for Comparable: It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that
   * (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any class that implements
   * the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this
   * fact. The recommended language is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that
   * is inconsistent with equals."
   *
   * <p>This is subtle: For KeyValue, compareTo only looks at the keys, while equals looks at keys and values,
   * so compareTo returning 0 implies the keys are the same, but <i>says nothing about the values</i>.
   *
   * <p>a.equals(b) implies a.compareTo(b) == 0, but not the other way around.
   *
   * <p>This behavior makes it possible to build trees and other data structures with KeyValue
   * tuples as the internal nodes, going left or right on the basis of the compareTo function (which just
   * delegates to the key's compareTo function).
   *
   * @see #makeNoValue(Comparable) for creating a KeyValue with no Value inside, suitable for searching in trees
