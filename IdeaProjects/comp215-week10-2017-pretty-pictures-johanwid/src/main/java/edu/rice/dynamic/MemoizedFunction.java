  // Engineering notes: MemoizedFunction just returns Functions so the resulting instance types can
  // be used anywhere that a lambda might be expected. Also, we're internally using java.util.HashMap.
  // In week4, we'll introduce an alternative, "TreapMap". The details below will make more sense then, but
  // anyway: We're using Java's HashMap for two reasons.
  //
  // One: fundamentally we're mutating the map and we never need to save an old version. There's no benefit to
  // using a functional map.
  //
  // Two: TreapMap requires its keys to be Comparable, which would be unnecessarily constraining. HashMap
  // only requires its keys to support equals() and hashCode(), which are part of java.lang.Object. This
  // means we can define MemoizedFunction without any type constraints on T.

  /**
   * If you want to memoize a recursive function, then your function needs something to call besides itself.
   * So, rather than using a lambda that maps input to output, here we expect a lambda that takes two arguments,
   * the first of which will be something you can call when you want to be recursive. The second argument is
   * the usual argument to your function.
   *
   * <p>As an example, say you were using this to implement a memoized Fibonacci function, you could define
   * that function like so:
   *
   * <pre>
   * <code>
   * Function&lt;Long, Long&gt; memoFibonacci =
   *     MemoizedFunction.makeRecursive((self, n) -&gt; {
   *
   *   if (n &lt; 2) {
   *     return 1L;
   *   } else {
   *     return self.apply(n - 1) + self.apply(n - 2);
   *   }
   * });
   * </code>
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>Calls to <code>memoFibonacci</code> will run in linear time because the underlying recursive calls are
   * memoized, versus exponential time for a na√Øve Fibonacci implementation.
